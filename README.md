# Ranges to Table

This is a tool to change a table with overlapping ranges to single rows for each overlap. It was developed for overlapping time columns, but can be used for a variety of applications.

Here's an example:


![Alt text](congressperson_district_example.png?raw=true "Title")



![Alt text](table_result_1.png?raw=true "Title")
